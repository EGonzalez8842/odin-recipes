        <h3>Grilled chicken legs with the best seasoning</h3>
        <p>This seasoing blend is so easy and makes the most delicious grilled chicken legs.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> 3-4lbs chicken legs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil, or oil of choice</li>
            <li>2 tbs lemon pepper seasoing</li>
            <li>2 tbs garlic and herb seasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl combine lemon pepper with the garlic and herb seasoning. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Using paper towels, dry off the chicken legs as much as possible.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl combine chicken legs and oil, toss until the chicken is well covered.</li>
            <li>Once chicken is coated in oil sprinkle in about half of the seasoing mix, toss to coat the chicken. Repeat with remaining seasoing, rubbing the seasoing under the skin. </li>
            <li>While chicken sits, preheat the grill to 400 degrees. Once preheated turn the heat down to low.</li>
            <li>Place chicken on grill, making sure not to overcrowd, and cook, turning once or twice, until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees.</li>
            <li>Remove from grill and cover with foil, let chicken stand for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
